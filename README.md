# Shamehub

### Synopsis
Buried within codebase repositories are underutilized storylines with potential to be entertaining and vibrant sources for discussion and social connection. 

What if we could leverage these storylines to draw eyes and connect active developers over their common interest?

Shamehub is our answer.



This project works in conjunction with the [ShamehubAPI](https://github.com/TrystanKaes/ShamehubAPI)
